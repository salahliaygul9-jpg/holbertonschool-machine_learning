# Bayesian Probability

## Introduction

Bayesian probability is an interpretation of probability that represents uncertainty as a degree of belief rather than a long-run frequency. It reflects a state of knowledge about an event and provides a framework for updating probabilities as new evidence becomes available.

## Applications
Bayesian probability is widely used in many real-world applications, including:
- Spam filtering
- Medical diagnosis
- Weather forecasting
- Risk assessment
- A/B testing
- Machine learning
- And many more
