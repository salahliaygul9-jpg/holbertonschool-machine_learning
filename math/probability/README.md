## âž— Mathematical Approximations

---

For the following tasks, you will have to use various irrational numbers and functions. Since you are not able to import any libraries, please use the following approximations:

- Ï€ = 3.1415926536
- e = 2.7182818285
- $f(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{10} - \frac{x^7}{42} + \frac{x^9}{216}\right)$
