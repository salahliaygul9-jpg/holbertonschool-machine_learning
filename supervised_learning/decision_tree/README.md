# Decision Tree & Random Forest

## Project Overview
- Implement a **Decision Tree** classifier.
- Extend to **Random Forest** for better predictions.
- Extend to **Isolation Random Forest** for outlier detection.
- Understand node splitting, thresholds, and tree growth.

## Classes
### Node
Represents a single tree node with feature, threshold, children, and depth.

### Leaf
Terminal node with a value and depth.

### Decision_Tree
- Builds trees with max depth and minimum population constraints.
- Methods to **fit** data and **predict** targets.

### Random_Forest & Isolation_Random_Forest
- Ensembles of decision trees for better predictions or outlier detection.
